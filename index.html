   <h2> Hello my fellow humans, as you may already know, there is a deadly virus that is ravaging the world as we speak. 
   </h2>
   <P>
      Our days are numbered now that we are faced with this catastrophe. Countless years of fictional films, books, etc based on our dead loved ones rising and of viruses attacking the human race forcing them to cannibalize. Now we are faced with the possiblillity of it all becoming reality.
      While the chance for human existance to continue on through this tragedy are low. I have compiled a list of tips and advice on how you may be able to survive and work towards taking back our planet. READ THIS CAREFULLY! Be sure to save this for future references, while you still may have acess to the web and to the powergrid.

            Here are a few well educated tips and advice for survival and to lower risk of infection:
         </h2>
         <ol>
            <li class ="a"> Stay ayway from the infected! </li>
           <li class="b">The chances for survival after one contracts this deadly virus, as far as I am aware, are slim to none. The Covid-29 virus takes about 16 hrs to replicate, although it varies from individual to individual. If someone you know shows any of the following symptoms listed above it is likley to late for them. You must distance yourself away from them as far as you can immediatly and <b>never look back!</b>
            An alternative decision is the hardest, but is the most logical and humane way. Would be termination of the infected before they succum to their injuries. <b>They Are No Longer the people they once were!</b>
           </li> 
           <li class="a"> If attacked by infected check body for puncture wounds or bite marks</li>">

           <figcaption> When bitten/injured by infected, bodidly fluids can be passed on easily. </figcaption>
           </figure>
           <li class = "a"> Don&apos;t drink the water
            </li>
            <li class = "b">You must stock up on water while you can. Due to the virus it is unsure
               if the water is safe to consume.
            </li>
            <li class = "a"> Just because you have shelter doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re safe!</li>
            <li cLass ="b">They might not be very coordinated, but zombies can still break through barriers, especially en masse. They are highly <b>DANGEROUS!</b> Try to find somewhere as far way and safe as possible that you can.</li>
            <li class = "a">Wear protective Gear/clothing</li>
            </li>

         <p> While the goverment officials are hiding informaton from us, the citizens are left in the dark. I hope this website reaches many of you before it is to late.
            Act now or this world as we know it, may well be lost! Remember to always remain aleart and ready for anything. Be very cautious of you who you allow in your circle. You never know when you could be stabbed in the back by your fellow humans. Friends can become foes very quickly. 
         </p>
         <p>This is my gift to humanity. May god bless</p>
