   <h2 id = descripton> Hello my fellow humans, as you may already know, there is a deadly virus that is ravaging the world as we speak and maybe as you are reading this website .
   </h1>
   <P >
      Our days are numbered now that we are faced with this catastrophe. Countless years of fictional films, books, etc based on our dead love ones rising and of viruses attacking the human race forcing them to canibalise. Who would've been prepared for it all to become reality. 
      While the chance for human existance to continue on through this tragedy are very low. I have compiled a list of tips and advice on how you may be able to survive and work towards taking back our planet. READ THIS CAREFULLY! Be sure to save this for future references, while you still may have acess to the web and powergrid.

      <h2> What is Covid-29?</h2>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> While the general public, may not be aware of what causes this disease.
       With the information that has been provided from goverment officials and the scientific research tested by my fellow colloueges and I. We are able to conclude that when infected with this particaluar virus you may experice most but not all of these symptoms: </p>
       <ol>
         <li class = "a"> Dementia </li>
         <li class = "b">
            The loss of cognitive functioning â€” thinking, remembering, and reasoning
         </li>
         <li class = "a">Discoloration of the wound, which increases as the virus replicates itself</li>
         <li class = "a">Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
         <li class = "a"> Paralysis in the Extremities</li> 
         <li class = "b">The loss of muscle function in the lower and upper half of the body </li>
       
         <li class = "a">Fever or chills</li>
         <li class = "a">Nausea or vomiting</li>
         <li class = "a">Uncontrollable desire to consume human flesh

         <img src = "C:\Users\guess1\OneDrive\html-me-something\zombies brain.jpg" alt="Image of affected areas in brain caused by the covid-29 virus">
         <figcaption style= "color: green"> The virus is centered on the brain, and destroys the cells of the brain replacing them with the virus. In doing so, the infected individuals are declared clinically dead.Once Covid- 29 has fully replicated, the victim awakes from the coma, with an unquenchable desire for human flesh</figcaption>

         <h2>
            Here are a few well educated tips and advice for survival and lower risk of infection:
         </h2>
         <ol>
            <li class = "a"> Stay ayway from the infected! </li>
           <Li class="b">The chances for survival after one contracts this deadly virus, as far as I am aware, are slim to none. The Covid-29 virus takes about 16 hrs to replicate, although it varies from individual to individual. If someone you know shows any of the following symptoms listed above it is likley to late for them. You must distance yourself away from them as far as you can immediatly and <b>never look back!</b>
            An alternative decesion is the hardest, but is the most logical and humane way. Would be termination of the infected before they succum to their injuries. <b>They Are No Longer the people they once were!</b>
         </Li> 
         </ol>
